{"google":"UA-33240227-1","body":"# Task Worker for Spring [![Build Status](https://secure.travis-ci.org/knalli/task-worker.png?branch=master)](http://travis-ci.org/knalli/task-worker)\r\n\r\nThe *Task Worker* is a _Spring Integration_ module usable for situations where the actual work should not be done in the \"main\" application.\r\nFor example, a web application should not generate and render a huge pdf document itself because of performance issues with Java Heap and Java PermGen size issues.\r\n\r\n*Note:* Currently, the Spring Integration configuration supports only a RabbitMQ/AMPQ variant. Feel free to provide an alternative. This could be easily done with Spring profiles.\r\n\r\n## Getting Started\r\nThe project is split into two single ones: The [daemon](https://github.com/knalli/task-worker/tree/master/task-daemon) and the [producer](https://github.com/knalli/task-worker/tree/master/task-producer).\r\n\r\n## License\r\nCopyright (c) 2012 Jan Philipp\r\nLicensed under the MIT licenses.\r\n\r\n## Contributing\r\nIn lieu of a formal styleguide, take care to maintain the existing coding style. Add unit tests for any new or changed functionality.","note":"Don't delete this file!
